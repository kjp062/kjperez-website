During my junior year of college, I told a friend of mine that I was starting to think about pivoting to tech. I had learned to code before, and I even wrote some scripts for an internship. He was really supportive and asked what I wanted to do. I told him data science, and immediately after, I told him I also strayed away from tech because I was terrible at math. He was quick to point out I just chose the path that involved the most math, and that was enough to discourage me before I even started.

Fast forward 3 years, and I now work in tech but not in data science. Still, my technical aptitude proved I could learn how to do what I do today, and I still had that voice in my head reminding me that data was _the_ thing I was interested in. Finally, with the time afforded to me by the pandemic (got to find the bright side right?), I embarked on my data science journey. I took some Kaggle micro-courses, got a good grasp of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (two Python libraries used for working with data), and went on to try the basic Kaggle competition: [the Titanic beginner competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).

I took one look and noped right out of there. I didn't know where to begin! I had no experience doing a data science project end to end, and I had no clue what I was doing. Turns out holding a hammer doesn't mean you know how to build a house. However, having a hammer and learning how to use it was interesting enough to keep me going, and so I plunged and purchased a course that was on sale by [Elite Data Science](https://elitedatascience.com/).

I might talk about it more in a later course, but essentially, their course taught me all the tools I needed to do analyses, create visualizations, train models, and put all those skills together. I sailed through the course pretty well, but then I reached the final module which is doing my own end to end project. To be honest, the idea of that was pretty daunting, and I put it off, but I didn't want to lose my skills! So, I decided to go back to Kaggle's Titanic competition.

That's what this little series will cover. I'm going to document my progress and thoughts while I am doing it! I'll upload my Jupyter notebook with minimal changes and some commentary to GitHub, and the posts on my site will be a more condensed version of that with the relevant information. Right now, I'm hoping to fit it into two posts: working with the data and model selection and training. If this goes well, I may do similar post series with different projects.

After learning how this stuff works, I don't plan on becoming a full-time data scientist, but I do enjoy working with data, so these types of side projects may very well be a thing in my future. Finally, I want to add that if someone out there is trying to break into data science, it is definitely possible! It takes a lot of hard work and dedication, but you too can start doing cool stuff with data if you really want!
