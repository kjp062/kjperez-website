After spending far too many months thinking instead of doing, I finally made a website! Some of my friends know that this is something that I've been wanting to do for months now. Really, I have wanted to establish a digital presence for a long time, but the excuses kept piling on: "Twitter was not a good platform for me. I'm too camera shy for TikTok and Youtube. What would I even blog about on Medium? I can't find a niche for my podcast." Well, the pandemic has been a good time for me to step back, reflect on what I want to accomplish, and execute on those goals! This post is about those goals and one of the first steps that will hopefully allow me to snowball into accomplishing them all!

## Why?

For a long time, I struggled with the idea of establishing a digital presence. To be honest, I was afraid that the permanence of whatever I posted would come to haunt me. However, something I learned in the past few years is that the only way to conquer this fear is to own who I am, be open to critique, and be willing to change for the better. With that fear out of the way, I realized how much upside establishing a digital presence had:

* I could define who I was on my own terms rather than the structures put in place by Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
* It could help me connect with people who inspire me to be better, and maybe one day, who I can inspire too.
* It gives me a platform to share my thoughts and reflections on things I'm interested in without worrying about things like followers or platform niches.

Essentially, a digital presence would be a tool that would open the digital world for a lot of analog (?) activities I find "life-giving". I love connecting with people and sharing with them, and that was limited by the global pandemic in which we find ourselves. This website will allow me to do what I love anywhere and anytime.

In addition to that, there is also a major "concrete" positive to this website: skill-building. I've been on a journey this past year to improve my technical skills, and this website is a big help for that journey. I currently work on a front-end heavy team, but my proficiency with front-end technologies is like my Japanese: I can understand but speaking the language is hard. This website gives me a good reason to practice my HTML/CSS and to learn Javascript.

I am also really interested in data science. In my senior year of college, I took a Data Visualization class, and I thought the potential that data had for storytelling was fascinating. That initial interest grew, and a little over a year later, I took a course in machine learning. I intend to use this website to share any projects I do.

On top of all that, this website will keep my writing and research skills fresh. Nowadays, most of my writing is limited to emails, meeting notes, and technical documents, so I'm excited that I can use this website to write about things like my journey in tech. Overall, this whole endeavor opens up a lot of possibilities, and I'm glad I finally took the first step.

## How?

The last obstacle was figuring out how I would execute.

I built websites before with WordPress, so I thought I would start with what was familiar. While using WordPress was easy with a clear end product in mind, it was more difficult with my own personal website which was more open-ended. I spent more time working around WordPress's rigidity to accomplish what I wanted than I did actually getting a website up and running. At the end of the day, it was demoralizing not seeing results from my actions. So, I decided to start from scratch.

After some time, I stumbled into the world of static site generators and Hugo. Hugo allowed me to start simply and take on more complex concepts later when I was ready. It also allowed me to use the knowledge I already had (like HTML/CSS and markdown) without worrying about server-side considerations and databases. The concepts I did need to learn were easy to pick up with Hugo's documentation and help from the Hugo community. Additionally, it reduced my costs to just the domain name because hosting and deployment are free thanks to Netlify and Github.

With Hugo, I now have an MVP version of my website up and running, and I am spending more time working on things that will actually impact my website. There is so much more I can say about the execution of this website, but that probably deserves its own post.

## What's next?

Now I fill my website with content! I have a ton of posts ideas with topics ranging from breaking into tech with a non-technical background to personal growth. I'm excited to write about how I got to where I am now and what I want to do next. I'm also looking forward to developing my skills to make this website even better.

Really, I made this website for myself to catalog my thoughts and experiences. I don't expect many (or any) readers, but if you're not me and you're reading this, I just want to say thanks! Hopefully, I was able to provide some value for you, and if there was anything you were interested in that you want me to expand on, [reach out](mailto:hello@kjperez.com)!
