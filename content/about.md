I use tech to solve people's problems.

Growing up with big dreams and few resources meant I had to be enterprising. While my family couldn't afford fancy prep books or tutors, I had all I needed: a computer. From childhood to now, I've used technology to learn new skills, connect with people, make my finances something fun, make my schedule work for me, and more.

During an internship in my junior year at Georgetown University, I realized that what I wanted to do was make tech work for everyone else like I had done for myself. 

Now, my job is to help build products that let organizations harness the power of digital transformation to improve their clients' experiences.

I'm hoping to be inspired, come up with innovative solutions to big problems, learn new things, share what I know, and surround myself with people who help me by my best self.
